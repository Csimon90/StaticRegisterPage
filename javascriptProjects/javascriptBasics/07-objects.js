    name            : "Zelda",
    age             : 17,
    title           : "Princess",
    isCaptured      : true
};

// Objects can be stored in variables.
// Objects always use {} surrounding the data contained.
// name, age, title, and isCaptured  are properties or keys of the object. Each has a colon (:) preceding the value.
// Each of the properties has a value. "Zelda"   17   "Princess"   true.

console.log(zelda); //1
console.log(zelda.name); //2
console.log(zelda.age); //3

console.log(zelda.middleName); //undefined: middleName does not exist

// Practice and Understanding
// console.log the value of title from the Zelda object using dot notation.
// Do the same as above for isCaptured
// Create another object  named player.
// Add properties named username, power, and toughness.
// Assign values for each property.
// Display the player's username.
// More Practice
// Make more objects. Work on getting the syntax and have fun. Use the prompts below or make your own in order to create at least 3 more objects.

// Make a friend object with at least four properties.
// Make another object called movie with three properties
// Make an object about anything you want (recipe, car, sports team etc).
